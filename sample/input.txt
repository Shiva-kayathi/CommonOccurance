Const. Daniel Montsion’s defence team has formally asked for a stay on all charges after serving court with a charter application alleging evidence was “lost or destroyed” and alleging “abuse of process” in the mishandling of critical video evidence showing the fatal arrest of Abdirahman Abdi.

The defence team of Michael Edelson and Solomon Friedman on Wednesday served court with the application, one of three potential charter motions the defence told the judge it was considering back in the opening days of the trial.

That notice followed the “bombshell” disclosure of alternate versions of CCTV video footage, which was used by Special Investigations Unit investigators, and has been acknowledged by all parties as a “centrepiece” of the manslaughter and assault case against Montsion.

He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his defence team is now asking Ontario Court Justice Robert Kelly to bring about a swift end to the Ottawa officer’s trial.
